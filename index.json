Your email is the preferred way for hackers to communicate with you. The days of pixelated logos and bad spelling are long gone. Now it‚Äôs legitimate emails that look like phishing attempts. But even without counting all the phishing risks you‚Äôre exposing yourself and your organization to, another way to harm you is through scams: Example If a scammer has your email address, he or she can easily gather other information about you, such as your name, where you live, your children‚Äôs school, where you work, or even on your co-workers. This scammer can then call you and use these facts to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that he or she is bona fide, and thus attempt to gain access to other information to impersonate you.

As you can guess, all these infos simplify a LOT the data collection process. I admit that simply taking a look at a GitHub profile is not technical at all, but hey ! It‚Äôs still open source intelligence ! Plus, it gives a very small footprint because GitHub sees you as a normal visitor browsing a normal user profile.

We knew his username (it was his IG nickname) as well as his password, as he was reusing the same damn password everywhere. A quick port scan with Nmap showed a whole bunch of open ports, including SSH. We tried to connect to his laptop through SSH‚Ä¶and it successfully worked ! The biggest question was, ‚ÄúWhat do to now ?‚Äù Tbh, I can‚Äôt remember exactly what we did next. I‚Äôm pretty sure that we had overloaded his desktop folder with blank files and changed his wallpaper to a picture of his desktop actually being full of blank files so that he can‚Äôt remove those files because it‚Äôs a part of his wallpaper. Trust me, his live reaction when this happened was priceless !

A real cyberattack would have had catastrophic impacts. We can imagine that instead of scaring our friend, we could have set up a second backdoor, even more discreet to be more persistent and from there, reroute all our traffic to our friend‚Äôs LAN. After all, all his router is doing is simply exposing all his server‚Äôs ports, there is no firewall rule that would prevent us from doing so. At the time when we made the joke, Eternalblue / DoublePulsar had just been released, it was a critical flaw impacting Windows boxes that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. We would have used this flaw to have a firm foothold on all the Windows boxes of his network and so on until all his entire network would be compromised ! Even for a simple individual, the impact can be huge : imagine one day turning on your computer and see a cryptolocker. Turning on your laptop to look for the solution online and see that your laptop as well as all the other computers in your house are cryptolocked ! What‚Äôs even scarier is that thousands of companies around the world have woken up in this state.

It is owned by root and has 644 permissions, meaning that the file can only be modified by root or sudo users, but it is readable by all system users. The second one, on the other hand, is only accessible by root or sudo users because it contains all the system‚Äôs users passwords. Don‚Äôt get too excited, those passwords are heavily encrypted, so don‚Äôt expect to get your password and guess in the process your whole user‚Äôs just by looking inside this file !

Once connected we will reset our password following the standard procedure because by principle I don‚Äôt trust my computer. To do so, I‚Äôve searched a lot and I found this solution using Python3 : python3 -c \"from getpass import getpass; from crypt import *; \\ p=getpass(); print('\\n'+crypt(p, METHOD_SHA512)) \\ if p==getpass('Please repeat: ') else print('\\nFailed repeating.')\" This solution has the following benefits: Nothing additional to install (Python 3 is widely supported) Does not store the password in your shell history. Generates a random salt for you. Uses a modern, strong hashing algorithm (SHA-512) Re-prompts for the password to avoid mistakes. The next step is quite simple, because you just need to copy / paste the new hash to the etc/shadow file to override the previous one. /!\\ CHECKPOINT : MAKE SURE YOU ARE EDITING etc/shadow AND NOT /etc/shadow !!!

It is one of the three largest television networks in the world, accessible to 291 million households in 200 countries and territories. It broadcasts 10 distinct regionalized signals, 2 thematic channels and 2 web TVs. At the end of March 2015, the French national agency for the security of information systems (ANSSI) warned TV5 Monde of a fraudulent use of one of its unprotected servers. The agency takes the server in question for analysis and the international channel starts looking for a security auditor. On April 8, 2015, TV5 Monde inaugurated its new theme channel on the ‚ÄúFrench art of living,‚Äù TV5 Monde Style HD, in the presence of Foreign Minister. The channel is to broadcast programs in the Middle East and Asia on fashion, luxury, hotels, jewelry, gastronomy, oenology, design, garden art, architecture, and cultural and historical heritage.

Even though the main and backup infrastructure are neutralized at once, the channel‚Äôs IT director and his team initially believe it is a technical failure. But a few minutes later, the email server is destroyed, confirming a cyber attack. For the IT director, it was a ‚Äúlightning attack that was probably very well prepared‚Äù. To limit the damage, the technical teams shut down the entire network at around 10 pm, interrupting the channel‚Äôs television broadcasts worldwide. At the same time, the channel‚Äôs Twitter and Facebook accounts were also hacked. Messages of support for the Islamic State in English, Arabic and French were posted, as well as documents presented as identity documents and CVs of relatives of French soldiers involved in operations against ISIS. One message accuses French President Fran√ßois Hollande of having committed ‚Äúan unforgivable fault‚Äù by waging ‚Äúa war that serves no purpose,‚Äù rewarded by ‚ÄúJanuary‚Äôs gifts to Charlie Hebdo and the Hyper Cacher,‚Äù referring to the January 2015 attacks in France. The message also states that the French government is ‚Äúnot prepared to accept any responsibility for the attacks. Shortly before midnight, the technical teams managed to regain control of the social networks and posted messages of explanation to Internet users. The CEO of TV5 Monde, Yves Bigot, posted a video on Facebook and spoke of an ‚Äúextremely powerful cyberattack ‚Äú. On April 9, starting at 5:00 a.m. EDT, the computer system and the television signals were progressively restarted with the help of about fifteen computer security engineers from the ANSSI who were dispatched to the site. At around 10:00 am, all the channels on the network were restored but they could only broadcast pre-recorded programs, and not the news in their own production. At 6 pm, the channel resumed normal broadcasting with its live news program ‚Äú64' Le Monde en Fran√ßais‚Äù.

Then they took the time to develop a specific malware capable of messing up any hardware used for example to encode and transmit the broadcasts. Their attack was carried out from 7 different entry points, spread all over the world and they even attacked the Dutch company that provided the remote control cameras used in TV5 studios. Fortunately for TV5, that day was the launch of a new channel. All the technicians were on site and the situation gradually returned to normal thanks to their work.

In total, this operation cost more than 5 million euros to TV5 Monde for the first year followed by 3 million euros the following year to invest in new protection systems. Since then, the police have investigated and it is now known that the attack was carried out by a group of Russian cyber criminals known as APT 28, who tried to hide their action behind ISIS by posting messages falsely attributed to the ‚ÄúCyber Caliphate‚Äù on social networks. It has also been proven that the attack was clearly intended to destroy TV5 Monde. It was not a question of recovering confidential information (i.e. espionnage), but rather a pure desire to destroy. This whole story, which fortunately ends well, is just one more proof that security is not something to be taken lightly, and that it is better to invest ‚Äúa little‚Äù in security now than ‚Äúa lot‚Äù later to repair the damage.

While downtime is not new to Facebook, this outage is certainly one that will go down in the company‚Äôs history books. Facebook Inc. released a brief statement on the evening of Oct. 4, primarily to refute conspiracy theories that had been spreading on social media. More details about what caused the business to go down were later released on Oct. 5. A blog post published by the company essentially confirmed what was already known, as detailed by Cloudflare: Facebook Inc. somehow managed to block access from the outside Internet to servers running Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other properties, while performing routine maintenance. Facebook operates a vast network of facilities, including their own big data centers but also smaller facilities called ‚Äúpoints of presence‚Äù scattered around the world, to collect inbound traffic and direct it to its final destination through Facebook‚Äôs internal network. It‚Äôs a sort of custom Content Delivery Network (CDN) to increase availability, speed up load times and load balance all the traffic.

But on the morning of Oct. 4, the routine check was somehow executed and served as an order to withdraw all Facebook connections from its backbone network. In a post it published, the company said the auditing tool that was supposed to detect potentially catastrophic errors in configuration changes, failed because a bug in the auditing tool prevented it from terminating the issued commands. The infrastructure choices that Facebook Inc. operates compound the problem, and decisions made long ago regarding its internal facilities make recovering from this error much more difficult than it would be for other companies. In contrast to Facebook, which relies almost entirely on its own infrastructure and custom services to meet nearly all of its operational needs, other technology companies of the same size and resources are using infrastructure provided by third-party providers, at least in part, to meet their needs. This includes DNS servers, which run in those smaller access point facilities. These servers tell Facebook‚Äôs data centers where incoming requests for its content are coming from and provide a path for browsers requesting ‚Äúfacebook.com‚Äù to the computer at that destination (e.g. if european user it would be X.X.X.1, if american user it would be X.X.X.2, etc.) Facebook‚Äôs DNS servers are designed to inform inbound requests to ‚Äúfacebook.com‚Äù and, if they detect a problem with that path, they avoid the particular path to the data center, as delays can lead to a poor user experience. Under normal circumstances, there are many more working paths than faulty paths, and it is easy to find a quick detour.

Making things even more difficult, Facebook‚Äôs internal communications and disaster recovery tools rely on connections to the facilities that house these DNS servers. Everything described so far happened in the span of about two minutes on the morning of Oct. 4. The important thing is that Facebook needed to recover quickly from this world-scale error, and that recovery was more difficult than ever. And for some reason, Facebook‚Äôs out-of-band connection to its servers (the normal backup plan when the main network goes down) also failed. This meant that physical access to its data center facilities was required to fix the problem. While Facebook didn‚Äôt actually need to modify its server framework to fix the problem, but dealing with the server failure in question took more time than one might think.

Here are three lessons that can be learned from this incident : Prepare for the worst. Companies need to have plans for a complete loss of computing resources or network connectivity, not just a data center or cloud computing area that goes down but the worst scenario. Use the services of multiple service providers. While it is highly unlikely that the Internet as a whole will go down, it is worthwhile to employ the services of multiple service providers. Check priorities. Operations on the scale of Facebook‚Äôs cannot be implemented without the use of extensive automation, which means that code auditing tools (such as the one that failed to prevent this outage) need extra attention.

The DNS protocol works by translating the domain name of any website you visit each day, sending by sending a query to your DNS server. Same principle for encrypted DNS except that rather than sending in plain text, the query is encrypted via HTTPS. In this way, the DoH protocol hides DNS queries within normal HTTPS traffic so that third-party (ISP, Hacker, CIA, NSA‚Ä¶) don‚Äôt know which DNS queries are being sent by users. This makes it impossible to determine which sites are being visited. Moreover, the protocol works at the application level, meaning that the applications can integrate a whole list of compatible servers to which to send requests automatically (e.g. round robin). This list is prioritized over the default DNS settings advertised by your router. In most cases, the latter are defined by your Internet service provider and can‚Äôt be changed. Applications that support DoH can therefore bypass local ISP filters quite effectively and access content that may be blocked by government. Which is why DoH is currently being popular. It‚Äôs one step closer to improved privacy and security for users. Considering how widespread mass surveillance is becoming, it‚Äôs always good to take it!

The idea is simple‚Ä¶ Since our ISP‚Äôs DNS servers are lying and the public ones are maintained by fotune 500 companies interested into our juicy browsing data, the most logical solution would be to run our own DNS server inside (or outside) our home network. I first came across SimpleDNS Plus, a Windows software that allows you to do this easily, except that it‚Äôs only for Windows and that you have to pay for it, so shame on it. I obviously thought about the powerful Bind 9, but the configuration is quite heavy, so it‚Äôs not ideal to make a tutorial accessible to anyone. While browsing the internet, I saw that there was a tool called Unbound that allows you to do this on Linux as well as Windows and OSX. The main benefit is that the basic configuration is more than enough to get a properly configured DNS server.

When finished, you will see in the list of Windows services (Start -\u003e Run -\u003e Services.msc), an Unbound service that is supposed to be started and running automatically. If not, configure it to start automatically and run it. You‚Äôll have to configure your Windows to use your local DNS server, whose address will be 127.0.0.1. Go to the network settings and put 127.0.0.1 in the DNS field (and nothing in the second DNS field). And that‚Äôs it for Windows ! To check if it‚Äôs working, launch a terminal and execute ‚Äúnslookup‚Äù. If you use it to resolve some domain names, you should see something like this: C:\\Windows\\system32\u003e nslookup spyfox.me Server: localhost Address: 127.0.0.1 Name: spyfox.me Address: 104.21.17.108 We can see here that spyfox.me is successfully resolved through our local DNS 127.0.0.1. Finally, launch your browser and enter the URL of your choice. The URL may not be resolved right away. This is quite normal as it is the first time it is loaded this way.

One of the problems that webmasters have is because of adblockers, the tracking of statistics is now totally distorted. As Umami is hosted by you, under your own domain, it allows to bypass the problem and avoid adblockers. The tracking script that integrates into your web pages is very small (about 2KB) and supports older browsers. Umami is multi-user capable so you can set up an instance of Umami and let your friends use it for their websites if you want. And if you or your friends want to share your statistics publicly, you can do so by generating unique URLs. A demo can be found here for those who want to play with it.

Then run the following commands: $ git clone https://github.com/mikecao/umami.git $ cd umami $ npm install Then create the database : Command for MySQL : $ mysql -u username -p databasename \u003c sql/schema.mysql.sql Command for PostgreSQL : $ psql -h hostname -U username -d databasename -f sql/schema.postgresql.sql This import will create a login account with the username ‚Äúadmin‚Äù and a default password ‚Äúumami‚Äù. Then to configure Umami, create an .env file on the server with this in it: DATABASE_URL=(connection url) HASH_SALT=(any random string) Your connection url should be in the following format depending on the type of base you have chosen: mysql://username:mypassword@localhost:3306/mydb postgresql://username:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb Regarding the hash, it‚Äôs used to generate unique values for your installation. Then you just have to build the application with the following command: $ npm run build Then launch the Umani instance like this: $ npm start By default, the application runs on http://localhost:3000. It‚Äôs also possible to install Umami using Docker like this (with Postgresql): $ docker pull ghcr.io/mikecao/umami:postgresql-latest Or with Mysql like this : $ docker pull ghcr.io/mikecao/umami:mysql-latest ","date":"2021-09-11","objectID":"/posts/system/browser/replace-google-analytics-with-a-script/:3:0","tags":["tutorials","google","privacy"],"title":"Replace Google Analytics with a script","uri":"/posts/system/browser/replace-google-analytics-with-a-script/"},{"categories":["Privacy"],"content":"Make a good action !

The customers were used to address their requests through emails to the company so it was perfectly normal for an employee to receive an email with a file attached to it. In addition to that, the sender was already known as a good customer to the company. So, what did stop my friend from opening the attachment ? You may have guessed it, ISO files are generally enormous compared to small traditional PDF attachements as they contains a lot of files and folders. For instance, if you install an operating system there are chances that you have download an ISO image of several Gigabytes (or only some hundreds of Megabytes if you install a lightweight Linux distribution). But here, the ISO file would fit in less than a 1Mb disk space. A little bit suspicious isn‚Äôt it ? Futhermore, as I previously mentionned, ISO images are generally used to install operating systems but here, the attachment seems to be a notice or some sort of document.

Quickly the packet sniffer, the fake DNS and the Windoze victim system was up and running. After a simple double click, the ISO image was mounted onto my system. After some clicks into the newly created folder nothing really happened. Finally, there was no virus at all. Oh wait, what‚Äôs that ? Look at Wireshark : What the heck is that ? I quickly understand that the ISO file was used as an archive for the embeded backdoor. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was then used to communicate with the Control and Command server (C2C). As IRC is not an encrypted protocol, the login used to log into the botnet was clearly visible on my network capture. I had all the informations I would need to infiltrate the botnet. Clearly determined to put an end to the shady business of this hacker (or group of hackers), I decided to take a quick look just to satisfy my curiosity and know how does it feel to infiltrate a botnet. This is close of what I saw this day: There was a whole bunch of computers. I was surprised to see how many servers this shady guy got under his control because there didn‚Äôt seem to be any automatic module inside the backdoor. Only a reverse shell. The hacker might have dumped some files from his victims and access to the servers later. Among the zombie servers there was a lot of game servers including a popular World of Warcraft (WoW) server.

Indeed, even if I successfully infiltrated the botnet, I was unable to run administrative commands because I had the zombie permissions only. And even if I had, releasing all the zombies would have attracted the attention of the hacker without stopping him from infecting other computers. In fact, reporting to the police was the only way to stop this scam campaign and free once for all the entire botnet. That‚Äôs how days after days, after coming back from work I was checking if the botnet was still up. But days after days there was no sign of any takedown. I was a little bit disappointed but after a month or so my console showed me this result: Generally, in IT, timeouts are very badly seen. But here, it was the very cristalisation of hope. I remembered a blank Apache web server was running on port 80 (probably to serve as a web repository). All excited, I quickly visited the web server. I was facing a timeout error. In fact it was the entire server wich went out of time. My friend, being a passionate WoW player, got the (good ?) idea to play on the previously zombified server. He managed to have a talk with a member of the staff. Apparently they were targeted with a classic DDOS blackmail: if they wouldn‚Äôt pay, the shady hacker would overload the server with tons of requests, making the game totally unplayable. They were sick of those attacks because it was really annoying for anyone (except the hacker) and they were really struggling at how to mitigate those DDOS attacks without spending too much money. In my opinion, paying him wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything. Here‚Äôs why: If the hacker targeted other people, the Wow server bandwidth would have been saturated anyway because it would have been shared between the legitimate traffic from the players and the traffic to serve the attacks. The only way for the hacker would have been to completely uninstall his backdoor but hey, he wouldn‚Äôt be so fool.

In my opinion, the next important thing had to report the botnet for takedown. Don‚Äôt act on your own as it could have dramatic consequences. Imagine an increased security of the botnet and thus a more difficult takedown or worse : if you take the leads on the botnet and you get caught. In the eyes of the law you would be the puppet master and the real bad guy would still be in the wild.
