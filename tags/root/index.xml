There are LOTS of ideas to make life hard for the bot army that constantly probes the internet.
Well, thanks to &ldquo;skeeto&rdquo; you can add &ldquo;Endlessh&rdquo; to this list !
How does it work ?  According to the official Github repository, Endlessh is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner.
It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time.]]></description></item><item><title>How to reset a forgotten password (Raspberry Pi edition)</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/system/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-password-raspberry-pi-edition/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/system/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-password-raspberry-pi-edition/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>So today, we&rsquo;re going to look at how to hack your own Raspberry Pi in order to break any system authentication.
A bit of background  Last week, I wanted to make sure that my favorite device, a proud Raspberry Pi, was secure because there was an important vulnerability on a software I knew was installed on it.
Happy to open a terminal in order to connect via SSH to this little wonder, my pleasure was interrupted when I saw this :]]></description></item><item><title>PPA &amp; AUR : A security hole in Ubuntu &amp; Arch Linux ?</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/ppa-aur-a-security-hole-in-ubuntu-arch-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/ppa-aur-a-security-hole-in-ubuntu-arch-linux/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Arch Linux and Ubuntu are both excellent distributions whose security is taken very seriously by their people, but these two behemoths both have a BIG Achilles heel.
First things first  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong folks, I really like the philosophy behind those two distributions :
 Making Linux accessible to anyone for Ubuntu Pushing customization to the limit for Arch Linux (as long as we have nothing against systemd)  I also spent a lot of time on these two distributions using them as daily drivers, and they are both great !]]></description></item><item><title>Don't be fooled by this kind of UNIX-like backdoors</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/dont-be-fooled-by-this-new-kind-of-unix-like-backdoors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/dont-be-fooled-by-this-new-kind-of-unix-like-backdoors/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>I am seeing more and more attacks in the wild implying the use of a setuid mechanism to maintain a privileged access onto a UNIX-like system (Linux, BSD&rsquo;s, OSX, etc.).
A little bit of context  Let&rsquo;s imagine your system being hacked by any kind, it could be either :
 An unfortunate weak password guess A malicious physical access A chad NSA 0day slamming your ports &hellip;    As you are someone who knows a little bit about IT security, you successfully manage to patch your system and change all your passwords, locking out the hackers.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
