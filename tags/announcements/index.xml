It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I last looked at my old blog. To give you an idea, the domain name expired a long time ago, turning my website into a wonderful giant billboard to sell viagra to the Chinese.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go for a new recipe to revive the website, much more practical for me, focused on minimalism and quality. I would add from time to time some old posts from my old site.</description></item></channel></rss>
