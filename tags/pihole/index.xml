&lt;/div>Pi-hole is a powerful network-level ad blocker that acts as a local DNS and possibly as a DHCP server. You can easily block ads on all your devices (TV, computers, phones, etc.)
A bit of background The Pi-hole project was created by Jacob Salmela as an open source alternative to AdTrap in 2014 and was hosted on GitHub. Since then, several contributors have joined the project, including dschaper, PromoFaux and DL6ER.</description></item></channel></rss>
