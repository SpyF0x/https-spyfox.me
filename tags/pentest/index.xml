            </div>If you want to practice Ethical Hacking, there are lots of websites like HackTheBox wich provide you challenges in several cybersecurity fields (e.g. networking, cryptanalysis, etc.)
But those platforms are most of the time companies wich have to be always online and hence, have strong security policies.
For instance, they can&rsquo;t allow you to bruteforce their challenges or to DDOS their entire infrastructure.   They have a limited number of environments and so sometimes it&rsquo;s just not possible to have fun since everything is laggy because of people doing some bruteforcing or anything else that challenges their infrastructures.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
