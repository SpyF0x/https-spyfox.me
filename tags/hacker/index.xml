&lt;/div>By design, your gateway has a set of firewall rules to prevent anyone from reaching directly your devices from the Internet
But this same gateway, has also an option called DMZ to cancel this protection.
First things first Originally, it is a set of rules to ensure that a server will be connected to the Internet, but will not be able to access the local network :
Your server becomes the front door of your network.</description></item><item><title>Endlessh : Troll any hacker with this cool SSH blackhole !</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/network/endlessh-troll-any-hacker-with-this-cool-ssh-blackhole-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/network/endlessh-troll-any-hacker-with-this-cool-ssh-blackhole-/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Firewalls, brute force detection, SSH on random port, geoip filtering, honeypots&hellip;
There are LOTS of ideas to make life hard for the bot army that constantly probes the internet.
Well, thanks to &ldquo;skeeto&rdquo; you can add &ldquo;Endlessh&rdquo; to this list !
How does it work ?  According to the official Github repository, Endlessh is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner.
It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time.]]></description></item><item><title>How to reset a forgotten password (Raspberry Pi edition)</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/system/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-password-raspberry-pi-edition/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/system/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-password-raspberry-pi-edition/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>So today, we&rsquo;re going to look at how to hack your own Raspberry Pi in order to break any system authentication.
A bit of background  Last week, I wanted to make sure that my favorite device, a proud Raspberry Pi, was secure because there was an important vulnerability on a software I knew was installed on it.
Happy to open a terminal in order to connect via SSH to this little wonder, my pleasure was interrupted when I saw this :]]></description></item><item><title>PPA &amp; AUR : A security hole in Ubuntu &amp; Arch Linux ?</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/ppa-aur-a-security-hole-in-ubuntu-arch-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/ppa-aur-a-security-hole-in-ubuntu-arch-linux/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Arch Linux and Ubuntu are both excellent distributions whose security is taken very seriously by their people, but these two behemoths both have a BIG Achilles heel.
First things first  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong folks, I really like the philosophy behind those two distributions :
 Making Linux accessible to anyone for Ubuntu Pushing customization to the limit for Arch Linux (as long as we have nothing against systemd)  I also spent a lot of time on these two distributions using them as daily drivers, and they are both great !]]></description></item><item><title>Hacking - How to practice legally</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/red-team/capture-the-flag/hacking-how-to-practice-legally/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/red-team/capture-the-flag/hacking-how-to-practice-legally/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>If you want to practice Ethical Hacking, there are lots of websites like HackTheBox wich provide you challenges in several cybersecurity fields (e.g. networking, cryptanalysis, etc.)
But those platforms are most of the time companies wich have to be always online and hence, have strong security policies.
For instance, they can&rsquo;t allow you to bruteforce their challenges or to DDOS their entire infrastructure.   They have a limited number of environments and so sometimes it&rsquo;s just not possible to have fun since everything is laggy because of people doing some bruteforcing or anything else that challenges their infrastructures.]]></description></item><item><title>Don't be fooled by this kind of UNIX-like backdoors</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/dont-be-fooled-by-this-new-kind-of-unix-like-backdoors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/dont-be-fooled-by-this-new-kind-of-unix-like-backdoors/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>I am seeing more and more attacks in the wild implying the use of a setuid mechanism to maintain a privileged access onto a UNIX-like system (Linux, BSD&rsquo;s, OSX, etc.).
A little bit of context  Let&rsquo;s imagine your system being hacked by any kind, it could be either :
 An unfortunate weak password guess A malicious physical access A chad NSA 0day slamming your ports &hellip;    As you are someone who knows a little bit about IT security, you successfully manage to patch your system and change all your passwords, locking out the hackers.]]></description></item><item><title>An ISO file, a botnet, a World of Warcraft server and me</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/an-iso-file-a-botnet-a-world-of-warcaft-server-and-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/an-iso-file-a-botnet-a-world-of-warcaft-server-and-me/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
