# My return


Hi everyone, 

It's been a long time since I last looked at my old blog. To give you an idea, the domain name expired a long time ago, turning my website into a wonderful giant billboard to sell viagra to the Chinese.

I've decided to go for a new recipe to revive the website, much more practical for me, focused on minimalism and quality. I would add from time to time some old posts from my old site. I would try to publish a post once a week at least. 

Eventually I'd like to vary the pleasures between interesting stories, Tutorials and thaughts on specific topics or cyber news.

See you soon!
