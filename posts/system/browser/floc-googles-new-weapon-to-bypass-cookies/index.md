# FLoC : Google's new weapon to bypass cookies


I'm pleased to introduce you, FLoC ! An outstanding innovation brought you by Google LLC to make you meet a plethora of people exactly like you !


## What's a cookie ? 
---

It is a small piece of text that a website gives to your browser to store. This piece of text allows the website to recognize your browser the next time you visit the website. 

For example, when you set a website on "dark theme", it gives your browser the cookie "dark-theme: enabled". When you visit again this website, the dark theme is already enabled as it reads the cookies directly in your browser. This, is the good way of using cookies.

But through the years, some *very smart* people had the very evil idea to use the tracking potential of cookies to track people from website to website and to offer targeted advertising. 

Hopefully for us, cookies can be easily blocked with some browser plugins, or even by the browser itself (thx Firefox).

Without forgetting GDPR, which forces websites to offer now a "Refuse cookies" option.


## What's the matter ?

All these countermeasures are becoming more and more popular and for the very smart people profiling you and offering you some targeted advertising it's a getting a big deal !

When it comes to advertising, Google is the biggest player out there. They have flooded the whole Internet with their search engine, their browser (Google Chrome), their AdSense, YouTube players, Analytics, Android, Sign-ins, Gmail, Maps, their DNS 8.8.8.8 and even their servers ! Discord, for instance uses Google cloud servers.

It's just impossible to escape them, even if you think you are ungoogled.

So it's a mistake to think that they will be disturbed by the blocking of cookies.

## The new way to track people (cookies-free)
---

With your browsing history, your installed plugins, your hardware configuration and a lot of other parameters, it is possible to generate a pretty unique fingerprint of your device. 

It is already technically exceptional, but Google goes even further, as it no longer individualizes you, but rather sorts you into interest groups based on your current month's history. 

This way, if you are, for instance, an overweight geek located in the US and you like World of Warcraft and Asian food, you will be in the same group as all your fellow peers.

Google will then be able to offer you targeted advertising for the category you belong to. So there is no more individual tracking, but rather profiling based on your history. 

Which circumvent a lot GDPR, because tracking a group of anonymous individual through their web browsing history is not yet considered as a privacy violation. 

## What's FLoC ?
---

This technology developed by Google is called Federated Learning of Cohorts, a.k.a. FLoC. Each group is designated by its FLoC ID and characterized by its habits and interests. No more cookies needed.

It's like clich√©s, there are some people who are similar in their interests as well as in their habits. It will be the future of advertising... and it will be a real pain in the a$$ to escape it !

Google has begun to deploy FLoC to some users of Chrome 89 or higher in various countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines and the US).

A monitoring set up in millions of users to be precise and without their knowledge. If you haven't already done so, uninstall this crap. But first, I strongly invite you to check if Google has already sorted you in one of these groups. 

To do so, the EFF has put up a site called AmIFLoced.org, which will tell you if your browser is part of the FLoC beta test.

## I'm positive to FLoC !

If you have been assigned a FLoC ID, it means that your Google Chrome browser has used your internet history over the last 7 days to calculate a "simhash" that will allow you to join one or more of the current 33,000 behavioral groups set up by Google as part of its tests, each containing a few hundred people. 

All of this is still experimental, so you can easily imagine that these numbers will quickly swell as the weeks go by.

If this is the case, don't panic. You can get easily out of it, but only if you uninstall Google Chrome.

If you use a browser OTHER than Chrome >= 89, you will not be concerned by this tracking...for the moment. 

I'm pretty curious what will be Google's next move. How will they impose this in Chromium or other browsers using the Chrome engine (e.g. Brave).

Will Firefox be part of it ? Only the time will tell...

## Make a good action !
