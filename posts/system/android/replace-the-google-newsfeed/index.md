# Replace the google (or any privacy killer) newsfeed


Here is a guide to swap the Google newsfeed with RSS feeds, a free, open source and privacy friendly alternative.



## A bit of background...
---
RSS feeds are a way to simply get news from the websites you choose to follow. They include article titles, summaries and links to view them directly into your browser.

With RSS feeds, there is no need for a newsletter, it's your rss reader which automatically connects to the feed to see if there is new content and display it to you.

## 1/3 Disable the default newsfeed (optional)
---
On the official version of Android you have to keep your finger pressed to access the settings of your home screen and then uncheck as on the image :

As many phones on the market are sold with a manufacturer's overlay to further track the user, the location of the box to uncheck may vary between manufacturers, but the rule remains true for 90% of Android smartphones.

## 2/3 Download F-Droid 
---
F-Droid is a catalog of free and open-source applications for Android. It is an alternative Play store where you can find some nice apps like [this ad-free YouTube player](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe) or [these RSS feed readers](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=rss&lang=en)

Here is a little procedure to install F-droid from Primokorn on F-droid forum :

## 3/3 Choose your RSS feed reader
---
Once F-droid is correctly installed and your favorite reader is chosen. All you have to do is to configure the reader and feed it with some links. 

RSS being very widespread, many websites you visit should already have an RSS feed address. 

Unless specified on the website, the default address RSS feed should be: example.com/rss.xml (as it's the case for this site). In the case of big websites , there should be a dedicated page that explains how the website manages its RSS feeds

That's it! That's about all you have to do to "ungoogle" your digital life one step at a time and fight against these GAFAM always ready to vampire our data at any cost, even at the expense of our private life.
