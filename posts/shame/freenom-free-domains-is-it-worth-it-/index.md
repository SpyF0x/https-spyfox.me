# Freenom free domains is it worth it ?


When it comes to building a new website, the question of the domain name comes generally quickly. 


Actually, that's quite obvious because if you don't have a domain name nobody will never find your website (except those bots willing to hack into your server).

## A bit of background
---
As you might already know, plenty of domain names extensions do exist. We can sort them into two non-exhaustive lists : 

These :
- .net 
- .com 
- .org
- .eu 
- .xyz 

And these : 
- .co.uk
- .cu.cc
- .esy.es
- .24-7.ro

The first ones are named "TLDs" whereas the second list is a set of "subdomains" 

In short, if domain names was real estate, getting a TLD would be equivalent to getting your own house, whereas getting a subdomain would barely be an hotel room. Here's why :

- TLDs : You own the whole domain. For instance with this website, if I want to create the subdomain blog.spyfox.me, hack.spyfox.me, ctf.spyfox.me or
even santa.spyfox.me, it's only a matter of DNS propagation time.
- Subdomains : You own nothing, except a DNS record, it could be A or NS but the fact is that you can't do anything except pointing the subdomain to your website. 

These limitations might explain why TLDs are not free (from 2 bucks) at the opposite of a plethora of free subdomains.


## Freenom the game changer

*Freenom, a name for everyone*

{{< figure src="/images/shame/freenom/Freenom-free-domains3.jpg" alt="a banner featuring exploited countries" >}} 

Nowadays, you can get a free TLD between .ml / .gq / .ga / .tk and .cf. All those country code TLDs (or ccTLD for short) does actually belong to countries with a small internet usage within their citizens (Mali, Equatorial Guinea, Tokelau, Central African Republic, Gabon).

In mid 2013, Freenom came out with a deal with those countries : in exchange for a bigger presence on internet, Freenom could use their namespace to register new websites at no cost for 12 months. 

Sounds beautiful, huh ? Well, you should probably know this popular saying that "if it is free, you are the product". Freenom is no exception to the rule !

Here's how Freenom takes advantage of that : once you've installed your website and generated some juicy traffic, Freenom will randomly take down your domain for "Abusive usage". They will change the DNS record to park advertisement billboards and generate revenues from residual traffic comming to your website.

Of course, their support is inexistant, and they will not hesitate to find any reason for banning your website. 


## Is it worth it ?

Here is some statistics coming from the 2018 TLD spam report  (spamhaus.org):

The latest statistics at the time of writing slightly differs from the previous ones:

If Freenom free TLDs are definitely NOT a profitable option for any user wishing to start a website, we can genuinely wonder if it's a profitable option for those countries dealing with Freenom to get a presence on internet. 

I would say, at the moment, definetely not. I like to imagine a malian citizen registering his domain name and getting constantely down ranked by Google because of "bad domain neighborhood". Because, yes, Google is ranking down websites with these ccTLDs.
