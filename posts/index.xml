&lt;/div>By design, your gateway has a set of firewall rules to prevent anyone from reaching directly your devices from the Internet
But this same gateway, has also an option called DMZ to cancel this protection.
First things first Originally, it is a set of rules to ensure that a server will be connected to the Internet, but will not be able to access the local network :
Your server becomes the front door of your network.</description></item><item><title>Endlessh : Troll any hacker with this cool SSH blackhole !</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/network/endlessh-troll-any-hacker-with-this-cool-ssh-blackhole-/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/network/endlessh-troll-any-hacker-with-this-cool-ssh-blackhole-/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Firewalls, brute force detection, SSH on random port, geoip filtering, honeypots&hellip;
There are LOTS of ideas to make life hard for the bot army that constantly probes the internet.
Well, thanks to &ldquo;skeeto&rdquo; you can add &ldquo;Endlessh&rdquo; to this list !
How does it work ?  According to the official Github repository, Endlessh is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner.
It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours or even days at a time.]]></description></item><item><title>Secure your GNU/Linux server with these few iptables rules</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/secure-your-gnu-linux-server-with-these-few-iptables-rules/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/secure-your-gnu-linux-server-with-these-few-iptables-rules/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>The simple fact that your server is accessible on the Internet means that it is being attacked every 39 seconds on average.
That is more than 2,215 times in a day !
Should we simply stop having servers ? Of course not !
Why such attacks ? When I say this kind of things (which are actually true) many people take it as a joke or worse, are skeptical :</description></item><item><title>Void Linux w/ encrypted boot, rootfs and swap on BIOS</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/system/linux/tutorials/void-linux-with-encrypted-boot-rootfs-and-swap-on-bios-/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/system/linux/tutorials/void-linux-with-encrypted-boot-rootfs-and-swap-on-bios-/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
                <img src="/images/tutorials/void/encrypted-void0.webp" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div>So today, we will see how to properly set up an uncomplicated Void Linux full disk encryption installation on legacy BIOS.
First things first  In case you&rsquo;re wondering :
 1. Why Void Linux ?
 I&rsquo;ve recently acquired an old laptop, so what&rsquo;s better for this old boi than an ultra lightweight systemd free GNU/Linux distribution ?
 2. Why encrypted ?
 It&rsquo;s a (bad ?) habit I got from work.]]></description></item><item><title>How to block Log4j with fail2ban</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/how-to-block-log4j-with-fail2ban/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/how-to-block-log4j-with-fail2ban/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>So today, we will see how to detect and immediately ban using fail2ban, all the creeps that try to exploit your servers with log4j.
First things first  If you haven&rsquo;t done so yet, check out here the official CISA log4j vulnerability guidance, which includes all the responses from a bunch of software vendors.
The problem The problem with the internet is that too many computers, in my opinion, have for the sole purpose to scan and detect all accessible and vulnerable servers.]]></description></item><item><title>How to reset a forgotten password (Raspberry Pi edition)</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/system/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-password-raspberry-pi-edition/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/system/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-password-raspberry-pi-edition/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>So today, we&rsquo;re going to look at how to hack your own Raspberry Pi in order to break any system authentication.
A bit of background  Last week, I wanted to make sure that my favorite device, a proud Raspberry Pi, was secure because there was an important vulnerability on a software I knew was installed on it.
Happy to open a terminal in order to connect via SSH to this little wonder, my pleasure was interrupted when I saw this :]]></description></item><item><title>PPA &amp; AUR : A security hole in Ubuntu &amp; Arch Linux ?</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/ppa-aur-a-security-hole-in-ubuntu-arch-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/protection/system/ppa-aur-a-security-hole-in-ubuntu-arch-linux/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Arch Linux and Ubuntu are both excellent distributions whose security is taken very seriously by their people, but these two behemoths both have a BIG Achilles heel.
First things first  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong folks, I really like the philosophy behind those two distributions :
 Making Linux accessible to anyone for Ubuntu Pushing customization to the limit for Arch Linux (as long as we have nothing against systemd)  I also spent a lot of time on these two distributions using them as daily drivers, and they are both great !]]></description></item><item><title>Turn your Linux into a router with a single script</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/system/linux/tutorials/turn-your-linux-into-a-router-with-a-single-script/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/system/linux/tutorials/turn-your-linux-into-a-router-with-a-single-script/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Want to turn your GNU/Linux machine into a powerful router able to connect to the Internet, to provide you a Wifi hotspot, to act as a transparent proxy or simply to properly route your virtual machines / containers ports ?
I have some good news for you then ! If you have an old GNU/Linux lying around (e.g. an unused Raspberry Pi), you can easily turn it into a router thanks to Linux-router (lnxrouter).</description></item><item><title>Block ads on Android with dns66/dns66</title><link>https://spyfox.me/posts/system/android/block-ads-on-android-with-dns66/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://spyfox.me/posts/system/android/block-ads-on-android-with-dns66/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">
