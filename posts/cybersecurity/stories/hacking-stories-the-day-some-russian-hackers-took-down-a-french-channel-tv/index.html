It is one of the three largest television networks in the world, accessible to 291 million households in 200 countries and territories. It broadcasts 10 distinct regionalized signals, 2 thematic channels and 2 web TVs.</p><p>At the end of March 2015, the French national agency for the security of information systems (ANSSI) warned TV5 Monde of a fraudulent use of one of its unprotected servers. The agency takes the server in question for analysis and the international channel starts looking for a security auditor.</p><figure><img src=/images/stories/tv5/tv5-monde.jpg alt=tv5/tv5-monde-attack></figure><p>On April 8, 2015, TV5 Monde inaugurated its new theme channel on the &ldquo;French art of living,&rdquo; TV5 Monde Style HD, in the presence of Foreign Minister. The channel is to broadcast programs in the Middle East and Asia on fashion, luxury, hotels, jewelry, gastronomy, oenology, design, garden art, architecture, and cultural and historical heritage.</p><h2 id=the-attack>The attack</h2><p>On April 8, 2015 at 8:50 p.m. EDT, TV5 Monde&rsquo;s broadcast infrastructure was targeted by a cyberattack. Even though the main and backup infrastructure are neutralized at once, the channel&rsquo;s IT director and his team initially believe it is a technical failure. But a few minutes later, the email server is destroyed, confirming a cyber attack. For the IT director, it was a &ldquo;lightning attack that was probably very well prepared&rdquo;. To limit the damage, the technical teams shut down the entire network at around 10 pm, interrupting the channel&rsquo;s television broadcasts worldwide.</p><figure><img src=/images/stories/tv5/tv5-monde1.jpg alt=tv5/tv5-monde-attack></figure><p>At the same time, the channel&rsquo;s Twitter and Facebook accounts were also hacked. Messages of support for the Islamic State in English, Arabic and French were posted, as well as documents presented as identity documents and CVs of relatives of French soldiers involved in operations against ISIS.</p><p>One message accuses French President François Hollande of having committed &ldquo;an unforgivable fault&rdquo; by waging &ldquo;a war that serves no purpose,&rdquo; rewarded by &ldquo;January&rsquo;s gifts to Charlie Hebdo and the Hyper Cacher,&rdquo; referring to the January 2015 attacks in France.</p><p>The message also states that the French government is &ldquo;not prepared to accept any responsibility for the attacks.</p><figure><img src=/images/stories/tv5/tv5-monde2.jpg alt=tv5/tv5-monde-attack></figure><p>Shortly before midnight, the technical teams managed to regain control of the social networks and posted messages of explanation to Internet users. The CEO of TV5 Monde, Yves Bigot, posted a video on Facebook and spoke of an &ldquo;extremely powerful cyberattack &ldquo;.</p><p>On April 9, starting at 5:00 a.m. EDT, the computer system and the television signals were progressively restarted with the help of about fifteen computer security engineers from the ANSSI who were dispatched to the site.</p><p>At around 10:00 am, all the channels on the network were restored but they could only broadcast pre-recorded programs, and not the news in their own production. At 6 pm, the channel resumed normal broadcasting with its live news program &ldquo;64' Le Monde en Français&rdquo;.</p><figure><img src=/images/stories/tv5/tv5-monde3.jpg alt=tv5/tv5-monde-attack></figure><h2 id=the-investigation>The investigation</h2><p>1 year later, the investigation showed that the attack was much more sophisticated than it appeared at the time.</p><p>The cyber criminals penetrated with a spear phishing attack, the network as early as January 23, 2015 in order to establish a precise reconnaissance of the technical infrastructure and the means of broadcasting TV signals.</p><figure><img src=/images/stories/tv5/tv5-monde4.jpg alt=tv5/tv5-monde-attack></figure><p>Then they took the time to develop a specific malware capable of messing up any hardware used for example to encode and transmit the broadcasts.</p><p>Their attack was carried out from 7 different entry points, spread all over the world and they even attacked the Dutch company that provided the remote control cameras used in TV5 studios.</p><p>Fortunately for TV5, that day was the launch of a new channel. All the technicians were on site and the situation gradually returned to normal thanks to their work.</p><h2 id=aftermath>Aftermath</h2><p>Once the situation calmed down, employees went back to using fax instead of email, they had to be trained to respect security procedures, a validation system for emails and USB keys was put in place and it took months and months before the company was connected to the Internet again.</p><p>In total, this operation cost more than 5 million euros to TV5 Monde for the first year followed by 3 million euros the following year to invest in new protection systems.</p><p>Since then, the police have investigated and it is now known that the attack was carried out by a group of Russian cyber criminals known as APT 28, who tried to hide their action behind ISIS by posting messages falsely attributed to the &ldquo;Cyber Caliphate&rdquo; on social networks.</p><p>It has also been proven that the attack was clearly intended to destroy TV5 Monde. It was not a question of recovering confidential information (i.e. espionnage), but rather a pure desire to destroy.</p><p>This whole story, which fortunately ends well, is just one more proof that security is not something to be taken lightly, and that it is better to invest &ldquo;a little&rdquo; in security now than &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; later to repair the damage.</p><h2 id=make-a-good-action->Make a good action !</h2><hr><p>Hit that <code>CTRL + D</code> to bookmark this website 🔖</p><p>Internet is for sharing, so please consider sharing this post if you liked it !</p><p>It will be so much better than any newsletter #privacy #spam #planet 🌍 ❤️</p></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 2021-10-17</span></div><div class=post-info-license></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md><span><a class=link-to-markdown href=/posts/cybersecurity/stories/hacking-stories-the-day-some-russian-hackers-took-down-a-french-channel-tv/index.md target=_blank>Read Markdown</a></span></div><div class=post-info-share><span><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Twitter" data-sharer=twitter data-url=https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/hacking-stories-the-day-some-russian-hackers-took-down-a-french-channel-tv/ data-title="Hacking stories - The day russian hackers took down a French channel TV" data-hashtags="stories,russian hackers,TV Monde"><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Facebook" data-sharer=facebook data-url=https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/hacking-stories-the-day-some-russian-hackers-took-down-a-french-channel-tv/ data-hashtag=stories><i class="fab fa-facebook-square fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Linkedin" data-sharer=linkedin data-url=https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/hacking-stories-the-day-some-russian-hackers-took-down-a-french-channel-tv/><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Reddit" data-sharer=reddit data-url=https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/hacking-stories-the-day-some-russian-hackers-took-down-a-french-channel-tv/><i class="fab fa-reddit fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on VK" data-sharer=vk data-url=https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/hacking-stories-the-day-some-russian-hackers-took-down-a-french-channel-tv/ data-title="Hacking stories - The day russian hackers took down a French channel TV" data-caption="The cyberattack against TV5 Monde is a cyberattack that leads between April 8 and 9, 2015 to the cessation of the broadcasting of programs of the international French-language television channel TV5 Monde, and the publication of messages of support for the Islamic State on its social networks." data-image=/images/stories/wow/An-ISO-file-a-botnet-a-World-of-Warcraft-server-and-me0.webp><i class="fab fa-vk fa-fw"></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Pocket" data-sharer=pocket data-url=https://spyfox.me/posts/cybersecurity/stories/hacking-stories-the-day-some-russian-hackers-took-down-a-french-channel-tv/><i class="fab fa-get-pocket fa-fw"></i></a></span></div></div></div><div class=post-info-more><section class=post-tags><i class="fas fa-tags fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/stories/>stories</a>,&nbsp;<a href=/tags/russian-hackers/>russian hackers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=/tags/tv-monde/>TV Monde</a></section><section><span><a href=javascript:void(0); onclick=window.history.back()>Back</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span><a href=/>Home</a></span></section></div><div class=post-nav><a href=/posts/cybersecurity/offensive/red-team/capture-the-flag/hacking-how-to-practice-legally/ class=prev rel=prev title="Hacking - How to practice legally"><i class="fas fa-angle-left fa-fw"></i>Hacking - How to practice legally</a>
