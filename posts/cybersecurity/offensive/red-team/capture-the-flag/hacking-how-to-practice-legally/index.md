# Hacking - How to practice legally


If you want to practice Ethical Hacking, there are lots of websites like HackTheBox wich provide you challenges in several cybersecurity fields (e.g. networking, cryptanalysis, etc.) 


But those platforms are most of the time companies wich have to be always online and hence, have strong security policies. 

For instance, they can't allow you to bruteforce their challenges or to DDOS their entire infrastructure.

They have a limited number of environments and so sometimes it's just not possible to have fun since everything is laggy because of people doing some bruteforcing or anything else that challenges their infrastructures.

This is one of the many reasons why many people are creating their own virtual environments.

Some virtual images are carefully created for official events such as black hat conferences or famous hackfests.

Those challenges and virtual machines (VM) are especially designed for learning hacking. That's why they are built with some vulnerabilities to allow you to practice safely, legally and locally from your own network.

The good news is that these VMs are so numerous that someone had the excellent idea to gather them all on a site called Vulnhub.

Vulnhub is already a few years old, so if you are a beginner, it is a must.

Note also that a good resource page is available and will give you access to some websites, books, tutorials and mooc to complete your knowledge.
