# KeePass - Forget Lastpass and learn to manage your passwords correctly 


I discovered KeePass two years ago through the "store" of my company, and especially through a colleague who warmly recommended it to me.



## A bit of background
---
KeePass is a tool, licensed under the GPL v2 or later, which not only allows a reasoned and organized password management, but also offers very practical shortcuts and other facilities that make everyday life easier.

## How does it work
---

KeePass allows you to store passwords as entries by creating  a "database" file (`.kdbx`).

This file is 100% portable and compatible with other software that manages `.kdbx` files, which makes it very easy to manage backups and to use the file on your laptop as well as on your phone or why not on your server.

This database is protected by a unique master password you *HAVE TO* remember, otherwise you will never be able to retrieve any information from the database (this is quite reassuring).

## What does it bring
---

In addition to password storage, KeePass allows :

- Password generation
- Automatic password-in-clipboard erase
- Additional information (address, description, etc.)
- Search option
- Synchronization script

## Portability
---

Portability is ensured by the support of the `.kdbx` format. Here are some applications that support this format:

- KeePass on Windows 
- KeePassDX on Android 
- AuthPass on iOS 
- KeePassXC (Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) 
- and many others...

## Add a password
---

The easiest way is to add a password when an interface asks for it :

- Open KeePass
- Add an entry to an existing category or assign it to a new one
- Save

## Use a stored password
---

- Simply double-click on an entry in KeePass (or CTRL + C), which will copy the password to the clipboard.

*Note: Don't forget to save the KeePass file (or the data it contains in one of the available formats) and/or to synchronize it on your different computers or devices if necessary. And beware of the many shady sites offering dubious KeePass, go onto the official site.*
