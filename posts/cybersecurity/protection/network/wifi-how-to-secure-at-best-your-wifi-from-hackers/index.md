# WiFi - How to secure at best your WiFi from hackers


As you could see on this [tutorial](/tutorials/wifi/wifi-crack/wifi-crack-your-neighbors-wifi-wep-wpa-wpa2-copy/) WiFi is vulnerable to a plethora of attack. Don't let any creepy stranger get into your home/company network with this tutorial !



## First things first
---
When you go on the Internet, everything you see or download is actually contained in thousands of little messages (a bit like postal mail) that are then put back in order by your computer. These messages (like mail) have a header (recipient, sender, date, etc.) and a content.

The problem with WiFi is that all those messages are being sent over the air in a range up to 100 m (~350ft) around your access point (AP).
Hence, multiple technologies are used by WiFi routers to encrypt those messages. 

Today, the security standard is the WPA3 protocol. Even if a huge portion of WiFi routers still use WPA2. It is more secure and easier to configure than its predecessors WEP and WPA, which are vulnerable, and therefore obsolete. 

## Choose a good password
---
Since its creation in 2004, WPA2 has been mainly targeted by password attacks. Its only vulnerability is human, and it is important to choose a very strong password.

This one must be composed of many characters of several types (numbers, upper and lower case letters, special characters) and especially not contain identifiable words. A good passphrase is perfect !

## Configure the network
---
Wifi networks are particularly vulnerable to so-called "Evil Twin" attacks. The criminals create a second WiFi network, which has the same name as yours. 

Unsuspecting users connect to the pirate network, which then receives the WiFi access data of the network's devices, and this is how your home / company network is being compromised. 

To avoid this inconvenience, choose an SSID (or network name) that does not identify yourself or your company. **DO NOT** use something like **FBI SURVEILLANCE VAN** :

Configure network access points as well, changing the default usernames and passwords in the operating software. Too many people are happy to keep the basic "admin" and "1234," which is a blessing for hackers.

## Install additional security components
---
All equipment that has access to WiFi should be equipped with a **GOOD** firewall and possibly with an intrusion detection system into the network, which should of course be kept up to date. Go check this [tutorial](/tutorials/diy-turn-an-old-pc-into-a-powerful-router-firewall-ids-using-opnsense/)

If you want to go even further, you can opt for some good old MAC adress filtering. This way, only the devices you choose can connect to your network. 

*Note: A stranger wouldn't be able to connect, this includes all your guests. The best to do with MAC address filtering is to create an isolated "Guess" network.*
