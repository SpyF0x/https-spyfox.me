## About 

Welcome to my website ! 

Being a computer enthusiast, I created this blog to share some tips and findings about cybersecurity on the World Wide Web. You will find articles written with love on different subjects, as much for beginners as for experts. I try to be regular, but it's not always easy :D 

Privacy on the Internet is a priority for me, starting with this website. I regularly post articles on the subject, and I actively support initiatives on the subject. This is one of the reasons why I always favor free software in my posts. 

As far as programming is concerned, I'm mainly proficient in shell scripts but of course, I know how to work with other scripting languages like PowerShell, Perl or Python and with pure programming languages such as C / C++, Java or .NET languages.
