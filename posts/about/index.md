# About


_Nickname_: SpyF0x

_Profession_ : IT security engineer

_Why this blog_ : Being passionate about my work, I force myself to keep a constant technology watch. So, rather than having my browser bookmarks full of tips and tricks about system security, networks or even on how to improve one's privacy, I prefer to formalize all this knowledge into a minimalist blog, faithful to my principles and accessible to everyone. 

_What I like_ : common sense, minimalism, initiatives to improve everyone's life one step at a time.

_What I hate_:

_Why SpyFox.me_:

Since I was a child, I've always had an unconditional admiration for spy movies. For the "F0x" it is a mix of my favorite animal (the fox) and hexadecimal (0xFFF)
