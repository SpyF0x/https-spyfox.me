# FAQ


I get a lot of emails where people tend to ask the same questions. So I will try to complete this FAQ with answers to the most common questions.

## IT stuff
#### _1. Which system would you recommend to someone coming from Windows or OSX ?_

That's a good question, not an easy one though. For sure, any system that doesn't come from a GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) will be much better for your privacy and your computer than those ones. 

I would say, you should be reasonable and use an easy to use Linux distribution as Ubuntu and at first explore it thoroughly (change icons, theme, desktop environment, get to know the console...).

Then, as time goes by, go towards something more refined, with an Arch Linux like distribution (here you start to become an advanced user). While continuing to increase the level by going towards more and more purified distributions, until a point where, in my opinion, the *ultimate* goal would be perfectly accomplished: you become the *uncontested* master of your machine by mastering *your* system. 

Only then will you have the most reliable, secure and optimized system possible.

## Social Networks
**_What is your Instagram, Twitter, etc. ?_**

I have a very minimalist view of things.

If I don't need something, I simply don't use it:
